# C++ Stability, Velocity, and Deployment Plans 

> Problems with stability, velocity, and deployment of the C++ programming
language as it evolves are identified. Policies are proposed to mitigate those
problems.
# Introduction

Over the past few years, the committee has increasingly demonstrated a lack of
agreement on priorities. As a result, many of the following questions have
arisen in committee discussions:

-  Is C++ a language of exciting new features? 
-  Is C++ a language known for great stability over a long period? 
-  Do we believe that upgrading to a new language version must be effortless? 
-  If so, how do we reconcile those effortless upgrades with a practical need
   to evolve the language? 
-  If we instead prioritize stability over all else, are we bound to move
   slowly - only making a change when we are certain it is correct and will
   never need future fixes?

It seems that members of the committee (and indeed the authors of this paper)
have held differing (perhaps even inconsistent) positions on these questions. In
the prior revision of this paper and the discussion in Toronto on that topic I
sketched out several areas where I believe there is room for improvement in
committee behavior.  This paper assumes familiarity with the R0 revision of this
paper (rather than trying to incorporate concrete details and proposals into the
body of and already long and complex document). The other proposals from R0
(Promise to Users, Standard Library Compatibility Guidelines) are being split
off and handled separately. Compatibility Guidelines in particular is covered in
P0921R0. 

Specifically, this paper proposes the creation of a new standing document
describing a substantive change in committee behavior.  As per usual, such SDs
require a plenary vote.  As an unusual step, I also suggest a plenary vote on
the proposed change in committee behavior.  I also recognize that some relevant
change in that behavior was already witnessed during the Toronto and Albuquerque
meetings - I would like to get a clear approval from the committee as a whole
(especially the implementers and maintainers of legacy codebases).

# Proposed SD Detailing Approach to Behavior Change Between Language Revisions

As suggested in the previous revision of this paper (and as was starting to
happen naturally during the Toronto meeting after the presentation of such) -
The Committee should be willing to consider the design / quality of proposals
even if they may cause a change in behavior or failure to compile for existing
code.  Rather than consider the effect of every new language version impacting
code all at once, we should be aware that the act of deploying a new language
version is likely already time-intensive - even an ordinary update to compiler
versions often requires significant effort.

Therefore, we assume users upgrade following a pattern similar to:

-  upgrading to a version of their compiler that supports C++n 
-  engaging diagnostics in C++(n-1) mode to warn of impending behavior changes
-  evaluating those diagnostics / modifying their code as necessary
-  turning on C++n mode

This requires additional diagnostics from implementers, and additional care from
users, but potentially unblocks significant avenues for improvement in the
language at a the cost of acceptable upgrade cost for users.

# Examples

It is important to note that the examples provided here are provided on the
basis of feasibility and illustration, and are not concrete proposals.  Please
consider in terms of behavioral change, detection, and the possibility to
opt-out in a compatible fashion. The general purpose of this proposal is to
allow us to focus on "Do we like this change" and separately "How safe is it to
make this change / how difficult will it be for users to adopt to this?". 
Otherwise we are forced to hold every possible change against the "no behavioral
difference ever" and we debate more on "is this safe" rather than "is this good,
and safe enough."

## Best Change: No behavioral difference

Of course, it goes without saying that the changes we currently value most will
continue to be considered best - changes to the language that have no potential
for impact on existing code. (That of course presupposes that user code is
well-behaved as per the newly proposed SD on compatibility guidelines.)

## Very Good Change: Statically detectable difference w/ previous-version avoidance options

The best newly-acceptable option: a behavior change that can be statically
detected and that has a options available in C++(n-1) that can make every
existing instance conforming. That is: it is easy for an engineer performing the
language-version upgrade to verify that nothing is affected in the end, as all
sites have been modified.

For example: we decide that we want new keywords to support coroutines. In order
to support that, we choose to make "await" a keyword. 

-  Detectable: In C++(n-1) we can issue a warning for uses of the new
   keyword in existing code (as variable names/type names/function names/etc).
-  Opt-in: N/A
-  Opt-out: Basic find+replace functionality will generally suffice.  For
   comparison purposes, reclaiming a keyword like await in Google's codebase
   would require edits to 17 files.

For example: In C++20 we decide to make the assignment + conditional ill-formed,
codifying the existing common warnings and instead relying on if+initializer
syntax from C++17.  That is:

`if (int i = Foo())`

would become an error in favor of the new syntax:

`if (int i = Foo(); i)`

or without declaration:

`if (i = Foo())`

would require the existing solution:

`if ((i = Foo())`

-  Detectable: We can clearly issue a warning for this (we have done so for
   years in most/all compilers)
-  Opt-in: Every existing instance can be converted to one of the two
   alternate syntaxes with no behavior change, in C++17 mode.
-  Opt-out: N/A

## Good Change: Statically detectable difference w/ previous-version opt-out

The most common newly-acceptable option: a behavior change that can be
statically detected and that has a syntax available in C++(n-1) that can opt-out
each potential instance of that change. This has somewhat more cost than the
previous, as each site of the impact needs to be tracked and evaluated, but some
(many) will remain in any given codebase when switching to C++n.  This leads to
increased but tractable tracking problems for those performing the language
upgrade, scaling with the number of affected instances.

For example: we decide that synthesizing operator <=> for some set of classes is
a preferable direction for the language. A user-defined operator< is assumed to
suppress that generation.

-  Detectable: In C++(n-1) we can issue a warning for classes that will be
   impacted by this change. (Obviously the compiler can statically determine if
   the class declaration makes it eligible for the synthesis.)
-  Opt-out: a type owner can opt-out in a backward-compatible manner by
   adding something like:
   
   `bool operator< (const MyClass&) const = delete;  `
   
   This would not change the behavior of the type in the previous language
   version, and relies only upon previous-version syntax.

## Possibly Good Change: Statically detectable difference without opt-out

There may exist changes that we decide we wish to make where there is no
reasonable change that can be made to opt-out. These should generally be
avoided, but may be decided to be worth it if the expected outcome is fewer
surprises/bugs in the long-term (or vanishingly few impacted locations).  Every
instance of the resulting diagnostic will need to be (manually) evaluated by
those performing the language version upgrade.  

For example: we decide to change overload resolution rules to consider template
specializations in the overload set (see the motivations in R0551R1).

-  Detectable: Although it might be expensive, we can issue a warning in
   C++(n-1) when performing overload resolution between a function and a
   function template that has specializations.
-  Opt-out: There is no obvious mechanism (at least none that I can think of)
   to generally say at any given call site which of those overloads to pick,
   especially not in a generic context.

## Bad Change: Runtime Behavior Change without diagnostic

We should obviously not do this to well-behaved code, regardless of whether we
accept the rest of this proposal. 

We should consider doing this to code that violates our description of
well-behaved, as per the proposed SD on Compatibility Guidelines.  For example,
if we suggest that move-constructors are always assumed to be no-worse than
copy-constructors, changing the behavior of std::accumulate to prefer move
accumulation is warranted.  (This would of course be a behavioral change for any
user-provided type that has worse performance on move or different semantics for
a type that is moved-into instead of copied-into.)

## Version History

-  [P0684R1](http://wg21.link/P0684R1) - Reduced iteration, focused primarily
   on describing the behavior change portion of R0. Discussed in Albuquerque. 
-  [P0684R2](http://wg21.link/P0684R2) - Removed reference to other SDs and
