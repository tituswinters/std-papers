    <h1>C++ Stability, Velocity, and Deployment Plans</h1>

    <p>TODO: Figure out sign-off. Consider asking for additional
    signatories, either from Direction Group in particular or broadly
    through the committee</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h1>

    <p>Over the past few years, the committee has increasingly
    demonstrated a lack of agreement on priorities. Is C++ a language
    of exciting new features? Or is it perhaps a language known for
    great stability over a long period? Do we believe that upgrading
    to a new language version should be effortless? If so, how do we
    reconcile those effortless upgrades with a practical need to
    evolve the language?  If we instead prioritize stability over all
    else, are we bound to move slowly - only making a change when we
    are certain it is correct and will never need future fixes?</p>

    <p>It seems that members of the committee (and indeed the authors
    of this paper) have held differing (perhaps even inconsistent)
    positions on these questions. In this position paper we aim
    to discuss the themes we've seen and heard on this topic in
    committee meetings, how those match our actual experience, and
    propose a concrete policy that the committee as a whole could
    adopt.</p>

    <h1>Present Policy and Practice</h1>
    <p>While there is no concrete policy written down as part of the
    standard itself, we believe that many/most committee members would
    agree that the current policy is roughly
    <blockquote>New versions of the standard will not change the
    behavior of existing well-behaved user code. In rare instances a
    standard change may cause build breaks, and silent changes should
    be even rarer. All changes should in principle be statically
    detectable. ABI changes should be avoided as long as possible,
    and be as infrequent as possible.</blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>Note that much hangs on the definition of "well-behaved user
    code." Currently the standard carves out a few things as undefined
    behavior with the intent of allowing for future changes without
    breakage. This includes (but is not limited to) "taking the
    address of a member function of a type from
    namespace <code>std</code> is UB, as well as more commonly-known
    things like broad prohibitions on adding names to
    namespace <code>std</code>. Do these prohibitions suffice to avoid
    breakage? Of course not. In many cases they are poorly publicized,
    but more fundamentally we make changes that could even break those
    users that do obey the few published prohibitions. For instance,
    users may still rely upon <code>using namespace std</code> and write
    in the global namespace - any overlap in new names
    in <code>std</code> and their global namespace is an immediate
    break. Using the global namespace is not forbidden. Nor are using
    directives. What gives us the "right" to break such code?</p>

    <p>More subtly, with SFINAE and existing template metaprogramming
    facilities, there is sufficient introspection in the language
    already to (in theory) have runtime/semantic dependence on nearly
    any library or language feature. Nothing in the standard declares
    it to be UB or otherwise gives the committee the right to break
    code that relies on things like "<code>vector::emplace_back</code>
    returns <code>void</code>" but you can certainly imagine
    constructing code that relies on that through metaprogramming
    trickery. We pretty clearly do not consider that behavior "in
    bounds" - metaprogramming users do not have an expectation of free
    upgrades between language versions. What gives us the "right" to
    break such metaprogramming code?</p>

    <p>In a completely different vein: When was the last time that
    your organization took a compiler update without having to fix
    your codebase? Even a minor compiler release tends to require some
    effort. Changing standard libraries is often near impossible - at
    best it is a significant effort. What makes us believe that enabling
    a new version of the language is going to be any less effort? Why
    are we worried about breakages that are likely lower-cost than
    updating compiler versions?</p>

    <h1>Proposal - Velocity, Deployment Plans</h1>
    <p>We suggest that the level of concern that the committee
    currently holds for breakage may be ill-founded - the cost paid
    during a compiler update stemming from from user error is already
    significant. We should recognize that all compiler/standard
    library updates come with some cost - so long as
    any <emph>intentional</emph> breakage on our part is expected to
    be dominated by those existing costs, we are still serving our
    users well.</p>

    <p>Procedurally, a change to the toolchain (be it compiler update
    or language version change) is a task that our users are already
    generally tackling as an explicit task - someone or some team is
    assigned to do this. For language updates, that upgrade period is
    the exact time that we want to provide diagnostics and refactoring
    tools designed to make the upgrade process low-risk and
    low-effort. Consider the cost reduction for users if we expect them
    to use the following process when updating:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Update to a current version of the compiler without
        changing language versions. For example, update to a current
        version of gcc while staying at C++14, rather than updating to
        current gcc and updating to C++17 mode at the same time.</li>
      <li>Turn on diagnostics in that current compiler version to
        identify places where behavior will change in the next language
        version.</li>
      <li>Evaluate those changes, fix them or mark them
        acceptable. For comparison, consider the idiom of extra
        parentheses in <code>if ((a = Foo()))</code> - a minor
        re-phrasing/re-formatting of the code tags this potential bug as
        intentional and known-safe. In this model, providing
        C++(n-1)-compatible mechanisms to opt-out of an upcoming behavior
        change becomes a new requirement for risky language changes.</li>
      <li>Turn on the new language mode.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This isn't a magic wand - we will still need to find ways to
    have pre/post compatibility and consider cases where the necessary
    updates cannot be done in sync (libraries with varying release
    schedules), but it is potentially a significant power that the
    committee is lacking right now.</p>

    <p>In such a world, we argue that it is far easier to make
    substantive changes to the language. For example, if we decide
    that synthesizing operator &lt;=&gt; is the superior long-term
    design, we can ask that compilers in C++(n-1) mode provide a
    diagnostic for types that will have their behavior changed by the
    new synthesis with an easy mechanism to opt out
    (<code>=delete</code>). This hopefully allows for a smooth rollout
    of more-invasive changes than we currently feel safe accepting. In
    such a world, we can perhaps stop arguing about
    the <emph>safety</emph> of such a change and focus more on the
    long-term value of it and the safety of the deployment
    strategy. In trade, we have to recognize what is already true:
    upgrades are not free. If we focus on understanding and minimizing
    the upgrade cost, we can find a balance between stability and
    velocity that keeps most users happy.</p>

    <p>This would effectively update the compatibility promise of the
    standard:
    <blockquote>New versions of the standard will not change the
    behavior of existing well-behaved user code. In rare instances a
    standard change may cause build breaks, and silent changes should
    be even rarer. <b>All behavior changes should be statically
    detectable in the previous language version and have
    previous-version-compatible opt-out mechanics to preserve existing
    behavior.</b> ABI changes should be avoided as long as possible,
    and be as infrequent as possible.</blockquote>
    </p>

    <h1>Proposal - Clear User Requirements</h1>
    <p>However, in some cases the above does not suffice: we have
    still not addressed our lack of guarantees for what types of
    breaks are considered relevant. Lets consider the simple case of
    <code>std::accumulate</code> and Peter Sommerlad's p0616. As
    specified, <code>std::accumulate</code> is O(n^2) when invoked on
    anything with an O(n) <code>operator+</code>,
    like <code>std::string</code>. This is because the accumulated
    object is copied at each step, rather than moved - by
    specification. The only code anywhere that can be broken by making
    changes to that specification is code with user-defined types
    where move is not an optimization of copy - and yet we are fearful
    to proceed. A "safe" deployment plan for this issue would likely
    require two language versions: one to introduce
    a <code>std::accumulate</code> variant that explicitly chooses the
    existing copy behavior, and a second to change the default - and
    with such a plan we are still left with both versions
    indefinitely. Or, we can collectively act boldly and say "Anyone
    broken by this change deserves it", which is likely true. Still,
    it would be more satisfying and healthy for the community in the
    long term to provide clear guidance - what exactly is it that we
    expect from users? Why do they "deserve it" to be broken by such a
    change?</p>

    <p>We believe the community would be well served if we defined
    what is expected of "well-behaved" user code. With respect to the
    <code>std::accumulate</code> example, this might include "The
    standard library assumes that if a user-defined type has both move
    constructor and copy constructor, the move constructor is
    semantically equivalent and no less efficient." More generally
    this would include discussions of namespace <code>std</code> and
    metaprogramming/SFINAE guarantees (specifically, our lack of
    guarantees).</p>

    <p>This would effectively update the compatibility promise of the
    standard:</p>

    <blockquote>New versions of the standard will not change the
    behavior of existing well-behaved user code <b>as defined by
    (forthcoming rules)</b>. In rare instances a standard change may
    cause build breaks, and silent changes should be even rarer. All
    changes should in principle be statically detectable. ABI changes
    should be avoided as long as possible, and be as infrequent as
    possible.</blockquote>
